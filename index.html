      <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Our salmon cookie story started in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood in 2013. Our founder, Pat, had purchased fish food to feed to the salmon at the Ballard Lochs, and decided to try some. He ate a little bit, then a little more, and before he knew it he was snacking on fish food and baking it into his food every day! He thought to himself, "If fish food is this good, imagine how good ACTUAL fish would be ground up in my food!" After this totally logical leap in thought, he opened the first Pat's Salmon Cookies on Pike and 1st. Since his first successful shop, Pat has continued to sell delicious, omega 3-filled salmon cookies all over Seattle.</p>

      <h3>Our Cookie-Making Process</h3>
      <p>We make our cookies with only the finest salmon bits, freshly bought from artisinal vendors at Pike Place Market in Seattle. The fish used in Pat's cookies are raised on vegan, gluten-free diets, and are nourished by fish-lovers who individually give them positive reinforcement every day until they are slaughtered and run through our state-of-the-art salmon incineration system. The incinerated salmon bits are made into the flour that makes our cookies, and other salmon parts (such as eyes, and certain bones) are used as our toppings! Then, as a final stylistic touch, we use our hand-forged salmon cookie cutters to shape our shape them. (See below.)</p>

      <h3>Pat's Chinook Inspiration</h3>
        <p>This drawing of a chinook salmon hung in Pat's room as a child. Its gaping mouth opened an abyss in Pat's heart that has only been filled by the opening of Pat's Salmon Cookies. Thank you, Chinook god. Thank you.</p>
